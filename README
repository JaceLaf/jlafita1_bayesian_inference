Bayesian Inference
Repository created: 2/19/2024
Class taken: Fall 2024

All my projects from my F2024 class on Bayesian Inference.
These all center around modeling of human cognition.
Most of these files will be in R or PDF formats compiled from .rmd files.

My final project for this class centered on the correlation between accuracy in lexical decision tasks and phonotactic probability of non-words.
It utilized a Bernoulli distribution and Bayes theorem.
